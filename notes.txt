all variable names are case-sensitivE and keywords of php yes

always start with $ sign to create a variable

you need to convert the date into an object


        $name = "Nigel Pogi";
        $Name = "Nigel Pogi padin";

        echo $Name;

they are both different in terms of variable

snake case for database = user_name
camelCase for variables = userName
pascal case for classes, interface = UserName
kebab-case for namespace = user-name

si print nag eexpect ng may irereturn, kay echo walang rinereturn, straight na sya


use multilines for functions
